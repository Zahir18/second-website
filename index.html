        Hundreds. Always Delighted to Watch.Kohli was appointed the vice-captain for the 2012 Asia Cup in Bangladesh on the back of his fine performance in Australia. Kris Srikkanth, the chairman of selectors, told reporters, "Hats off to Virat Kohli for the way he played. We have to start looking towards the future. The selection committee and the Board felt Kohli is future captaincy material."[123] Kohli was in fine form during the tournament, finishing as the leading run-scorer with 357 runs at an average of 119.[124] He scored 108 in the opening match against Sri Lanka in a 50-run Indian victory,[125] while India lost their next match to Bangladesh in which he made 66.[56] In the final group stage match against Pakistan, he scored a personal best 183 off 148 balls, his 11th ODI century. Coming in at 0/1, he struck 22 fours and a six in his innings to help India to chase down 330, their highest successful ODI run-chase at the time.[126][127] His knock was the highest individual score in Asia Cup history, the joint-second highest score in an ODI run-chase and the highest individual score against Pakistan in ODIs surpassing previous record of 156 by Brian Lara.[128] Kohli was awarded the man of the match in both matches that India won, but India could not progress to the final of the tournament. </p>

        <p>Kohli stood-in as the captain for the first ODI of the triangular series in the West Indies after Dhoni injured himself during the match. India lost the match by one wicket, and Dhoni was subsequently ruled out of the series with Kohli being named the captain for the remaining matches.[155] In his second match as captain, Kohli scored his first hundred as captain, making 102 off 83 balls against the West Indies at Port of Spain in a bonus point win for India.[156] Many senior players including Dhoni were rested for the five-match ODI tour of Zimbabwe in July 2013, with Kohli being appointed captain for an entire series for the first time.[157] In the first game of the series at Harare, he struck 115 runs from 108 balls, helping India chase down the target of 229 and winning the man of the match award.[158] He batted on two more occasions in the series in which he had scores of 14 and 58 not out. India completed a 5â€“0 sweep of the series; their first in an away ODI series.Virat kohli, The Record Talks for Himself. He Almost Lost in His Own Perfection. Pure Class With Sheer Aggression.
